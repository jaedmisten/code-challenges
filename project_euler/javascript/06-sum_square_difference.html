 * Project Euler: Sum Square difference
 * https://projecteuler.net/problem=6
 * 
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385.
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025.
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
